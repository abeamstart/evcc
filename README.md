## Getting Started

You'll find everything you need in our [documentation](https://docs.evcc.io/) (German).

## Build

To build EVCC from source, [Go][2] 1.17 and [Node][3] 16 are required:

```sh
make
```

## Sponsorship

Evcc believes in open source software. We're committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep EVCC alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwised closed hardware. Where this is not the case, EVCC requires "sponsor token" to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.

The personal sponsor token requires a [Github Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/andig) and can be requested at [cloud.evcc.io](https://cloud.evcc.io/). A sponsor token is valid for one year and can be renewed any time with active sponsorship.

## Background

<img src="docs/logo.png" align="right" width="150" />

Evcc is heavily inspired by [OpenWB][1]. However, in 2019, I found OpenWB's architecture slightly intimidating with everything basically global state and heavily relying on shell scripting. On the other side, especially the scripting aspect is one that contributes to OpenWB's flexibility.

Hence, for a simplified and stricter implementation of an EV charge controller, the design goals for evcc were:

- typed language with ability for systematic testing - achieved by using [Go][2]
- structured configuration - supports YAML-based [config file](evcc.dist.yaml)
- avoidance of feature bloat, simple and clean UI - utilizes [Vue.js][4] and [Bootstrap][5]
- containerized operation beyond Raspberry Pi - provide multi-arch [Docker Image][6]
